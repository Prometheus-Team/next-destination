# Exploration

The main function of this module is to provide the next point on the map the vehicle should travel to. The exploration module uses a modified version of the Depth First Search Algorithm to perform this task.

There are two major steps:
1. There needs to be a priority list for preferred steps
2. The modified Depth First Search algorithm needs the current position of the vehicle, and the map explored at a given point.
