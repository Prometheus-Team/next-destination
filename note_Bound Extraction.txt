starting coordinate (current position)

north/south/east/west


x currentPositionX
y currentPositionY

(x,y) currentPosition

np.array[<size x,y>] map

size of map
-> currentPosition[0] distance to left
-> sizeOfMapX - ^ = distance to right

-> currentPosition[1] distance to top
-> sizeOfMapY - ^ = distance to bottom
